### Weathering the Test: Environmental Drivers of College Admissions Test Performance in India  
*Work in progress — draft available upon request*

This study examines the impact of weather and natural disasters on student performance in India’s Joint Entrance Examination (JEE), a high-stakes test for admission to premier engineering institutions. Using a multi-level fixed effects model on combined test performance and weather data for the years 2019–2024, the analysis finds that high humidity on or near exam day significantly reduces performance, while temperature effects are mixed: short-term high temperatures negatively impact outcomes, but long-term exposure improves performance. Natural disasters also have a substantial negative impact, lowering average ranks by 82 positions per standard deviation increase in number of houses damaged. A robustness check using quantile regressions reveals heterogenous impact of weather along the rank distribution. The results are of relevance to national higher education policy.

Kerala is among the few states in India that have a successful record in fiscal decentralisation. This study qualitatively analyses primary data from three gram panchayats in Kerala to identify six factors that enable successful decentralised fiscal governance through Panchayati Raj: public participation, infrastructure and guidelines for governance, knowledge transfer and capacity building, optimum fiscal autonomy, local networks, and the state government as a facilitator. Based on the findings of the study, we construct a framework to assess the readiness of gram panchayats to carry out successful decentralised fiscal governance.

This study aims to explore the key factors that influence the monetary value of benefits that households receive from the welfare projects initiated by Gram Panchayats (local government bodies in rural areas) in Kerala, India. In the state of Kerala, Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) at three levels implement annual development plans and select project beneficiaries through a participatory approach. Based on an original cross-sectional dataset built from beneficiary surveys in two Gram Panchayats, I model benefit availability using determinants identified through a literature survey. The findings show that Gram Sabha attendance, household size, ownership of enterprises, credit status, and the gender of the household head significantly influence benefit access.
