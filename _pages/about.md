Welcome! I am a PhD student at the [Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy]([url](https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg)) at the [National University of Singapore]([url](https://nus.edu.sg)). My current research focuses on climate policy - specifically, using spatial, administrative, and macroeconomic data to understand the influence of climate-related risks on social and economic phenomena and the policy responses it necessitates.

Previously, I earned an MA in Development Studies from IIT Guwahati and worked as a pre-doctoral fellow at IIM Bangalore. My earlier research focus on local governments and their fiscal management evolved into climate policy during my stint as an intern at India's [National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD)](http://www.nabard.org/), where I did an impact evaluation of local-level interventions for climate adaptive agriculture.
